The TicTacToe-MCTS-Bot project is an implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game-playing bot powered by the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. The bot uses MCTS to efficiently explore the game tree, evaluate possible moves, and make informed decisions during gameplay. This project aims to showcase the application of MCTS in creating an intelligent AI opponent for Tic Tac Toe, providing an enjoyable and challenging gaming experience for players.
